## Experiment Protocol: Comparison of Target Acquisition Performance with Trackpad and Ergonomic Mouse

### 1. Experiment Title
Comparison of Target Acquisition Performance: An Investigation into the Influence of Trackpad and Ergonomic Mouse, Considering Fitts's Law.

### 2. Objective
The primary objective of this experiment is to compare the efficiency and accuracy of target acquisition using a standard trackpad and an ergonomic mouse. Specifically, the study aims to investigate how these input devices affect movement time and error rate, and to what extent the results align with Fitts's Law.

### 3. Hypotheses
*   **H1:** The ergonomic mouse will lead to a significantly shorter movement time for target acquisition compared to the trackpad.
*   **H2:** The ergonomic mouse will result in a significantly lower error rate for target acquisition compared to the trackpad.
*   **H3:** The throughput performance of both input devices will follow Fitts's Law, with movement time linearly correlating with the Index of Difficulty (ID). It is expected that the ergonomic mouse will exhibit higher throughput.

### 4. Participants (N=10-20)
*   **Number:** 10 to 20 participants.
*   **Grouping:** Participants will be randomly assigned to two groups (Group TrackpadFirst and Group MouseFirst).
*   **Recruitment:** Recruitment will be conducted via direct contacting.
*   **Inclusion Criteria:** Minimum age of 18 years, normal or corrected vision, no known motor impairments of the upper extremities.
*   **Exclusion Criteria:** Individuals with acute pain or conditions that could affect hand or arm motor skills.

### 5. Demographic Data and Prior Experience (Surveyed Before Experiment)
Before the actual experiment begins, participants will complete a short questionnaire collecting the following information:
*   **Name (optional, for internal assignment but anonymized for analysis)**
*   **Group (assigned by experimenter)**
*   **Age**
*   **Gender**
*   **Has used trackpad before? (Yes/No)**
*   **Has used ergonomic mouse before? (Yes/No)**

### 6. Experimental Design
*   **Design:** Within-subjects design with counterbalancing. Each participant will use both input devices.
*   **Independent Variable (IV):** Input device (Trackpad vs. Ergonomic Mouse).
*   **Dependent Variables (DV):**
    *   **Movement Time (MT):** Time from target display to successful click.
    *   **Error Rate:** Percentage of clicks outside the target area.
    *   **Throughput (TP):** Calculated according to Fitts's Law, as a measure of the information rate of movement.
    *   **Spatial Error (optional):** Mean Absolute Error (MAE) or Mean Squared Error (MSE) of the click position relative to the target center for erroneous clicks.
*   **Counterbalancing:** To minimize the influence of practice effects and fatigue, the order of input devices will be balanced across the two groups:
    *   **Group A:** Trackpad first, then Ergonomic Mouse.
    *   **Group B:** Ergonomic Mouse first, then Trackpad.

### 7. Materials and Apparatus
*   **Laptop:** A standard laptop with an integrated trackpad. Specifications (CPU, RAM, screen size, operating system) will be documented and identical for all participants.
*   **Ergonomic Mouse:** A specific, commercially available ergonomic mouse (model name will be documented).
*   **Software:** Custom-developed software for presenting targets and precisely measuring movement times and click coordinates. The software will generate 20 buttons per test run, with varying sizes and distances to create different Indices of Difficulty (ID) according to Fitts's Law.
*   **Seating:** An ergonomic office chair and a table, adjustable to the participant's body height.

### 8. Procedure
1.  **Welcome and Informed Consent:** Participants will be welcomed, informed about the experiment's procedure, and provide their written informed consent. It will be emphasized that participation is voluntary and can be terminated at any time.
2.  **Questionnaire:** Completion of the questionnaire for demographic data and prior experience.
3.  **Instructions:**
    *   Participants will receive a standardized description of the task.
    *   The clear goal will be communicated: **"Click on the appearing buttons as quickly and accurately as possible."**
    *   For trackpad usage, participants will be instructed to use **one hand for cursor movement (e.g., index finger) and the other hand for clicking (e.g., thumb or index finger on one of the trackpad's physical buttons, or on the spacebar/enter key if configured as a click alternative)** to simulate realistic usage and ensure comparability. The exact clicking method will be standardized.
4.  **Training Phase:**
    *   Before each condition (trackpad or ergonomic mouse), participants will complete a short training phase.
    *   This training phase will consist of 5 buttons to familiarize themselves with the respective input device and software. Data from the training phase will not be included in the analysis.
5.  **Experimental Trials:**
    *   **Condition 1 (e.g., Trackpad):** Participants will perform the target acquisition task with the first assigned input device. 20 buttons will be presented, with their position and size randomly varied to generate different IDs. The sequence of the 20 buttons within a trial will also be randomized to prevent practice effects (Power Law of Practice) on specific target sequences.
    *   **Break:** After completing the first condition, a short break of approximately 5-10 minutes will be taken to reduce fatigue.
    *   **Condition 2 (e.g., Ergonomic Mouse):** Participants will perform the target acquisition task with the second assigned input device, also with 20 randomly generated buttons.
6.  **Debriefing:** After completing both conditions, participants will be briefly asked if they encountered any difficulties and given the opportunity to provide feedback.

### 9. Data Collection and Analysis
*   **Data Collection:** The software will record for each click:
    *   Input device (Trackpad/Mouse)
    *   Target display start time
    *   Click end time
    *   Click coordinates (x, y)
    *   Target coordinates (x, y)
    *   Target size (width, height)
    *   Index of Difficulty (ID) for the respective target
*   **Error Definition:** A click will be considered an error if the click coordinates fall outside the boundaries of the target button.
*   **Successful Clicks:** Only successful clicks will be used for calculating movement time and throughput.
*   **Analysis:**
    *   **Descriptive Statistics:** Means, standard deviations for movement time, error rate, and throughput for both input devices.
    *   **Inferential Statistics:**
        *   Paired t-tests or repeated measures ANOVA to analyze significant differences in movement time, error rate, and throughput between the trackpad and ergonomic mouse.
        *   Regression analysis to verify Fitts's Law for each input device (movement time as a function of the Index of Difficulty).
        *   Consideration of prior experience and demographic data as covariates or for subgroup analysis, if sample size permits.

### 10. Success and Termination Criteria
*   **Successful Trial:** An experimental trial will be considered successful if completed without technical issues or significant interruptions by the participant.
*   **Termination Criteria:** The experiment will be terminated if the participant expresses severe fatigue, pain, or discomfort. Data from terminated sessions will not be included in the analysis. Technical problems affecting data collection will also lead to the termination of the respective trial and, if necessary, its repetition.
